Top Down Drawing of Raft Filter


At Abcam Fireplex, a particular manufacturing process called for the filtration of our product through a mesh screen. The term "Raft" was a company jargon for a bad product that needed to be removed. The design of this assembly started within my sketchbook, as a way to make a more robust part for this filtration step. Current limitations didn't allow for the filter mesh to be removed, which was problematic in the event of damage or deterioration.

Notebook Sketches of the Prototype Filter


From these designs initial designs, the Raft Filter came into fruition.

Raft Filter Assembly With and Without Cap


Equipped with a transparent tube with custom threading and an o-ring groove, as well as a removable cap, this assembly allowed for the replacement of filter meshes at will, while still creating a fluidic seal. The thread size was designed in order to achieve the optimal compression rate of the O ring of 20 percent, in as few turns as possible for user ease. Designing this assembly with a top-down drawing allowed for dynamic changing of the prototype after design reviews, and also allowed the size constraints of the project drive features.
