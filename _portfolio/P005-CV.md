Common Vice Self Titled Album Cover Art, Drawn by Shantala Mehta


Jumping into quarantine at the beginning of 2020, it seemed everyone had a whole lot more time on their hands. My close Friend Dan Peluso and I had been playing music together since we first met during our freshman year of college. We decided to sit down and get creative, and recorded, mixed, and mastered an album from the comfort of our bedrooms.

The entire instrumentation of the album was Dan and I. I play the piano mainly, as well as trumpet, and vocals. Dan covers the rest with guitar, bass, drums, some piano of his own, and a lot of vocals. It took a whole lot of work, and was definitely the peak of a relatively quiet year.

Our DAW of Choice: Reaper

We chose Reaper as our Digital Audio Workstation, because its free! We've gotten so much use out of it over the past few years that we've paid for the full version. In the screen capture you can see the different layering of tracks on the song "Summer of Nonstop Music".

It's available on all streaming platforms, just search "Common Vice" !
