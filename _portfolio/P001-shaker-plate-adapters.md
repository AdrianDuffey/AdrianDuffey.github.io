Single Shaker Adapter for Use with Stand-up Shaker

During employment at Abcam Fireplex, I assisted both the manufacturing and R&D team by designing shaker adapter parts. These parts allowed OEM shakers to be modified to fit the specific needs of a multitude of projects. Mainly, allowing sealed well plates to be shaken. In the aftermath of Covid-19, testing infectious diseases became a possible avenue of research for the company. I allowed for the possibility of infectious material to be integrated into different processes in the lab without creating a risk for the team.

Over the course of 3 months, I designed 6 different adaptor assemblies. They were all CNC machined, and modeled for use with metric and english fasteners.
