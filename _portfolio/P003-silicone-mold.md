Fully Assembled Microfluidic Chip Mold

With the second generation of manufacturing machines being developed during my time at Abcam Fireplex, I was exposed to a few different research projects to continue ameliorating the capabilities of the lab. One of which was a prospective adaptation to the manufacturing line that required silicone molded parts. I had been exposed to silicone molding before at Seventh Sense Biosystems researching prototype ventilation systems. On this project, I rebuilt the assembly from scratch to learn all of the minor details and understand how to fix the current problems.

Equipped with NPT fittings, fasteners, alignment holes/pins, silicone entrances and exits, and negative mold features, my redesigned assembly was able to successfully create the desired silicone parts. With the knowledge I had gained, I could lead the team in explaining the logistics of future changes to be made, as well as implementing those changes.
