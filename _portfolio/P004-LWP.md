Top Down Drawing of the "Large Well Plate"

At Abacam Fireplex, our manufacturing process was constrained by the industry standard 96 well plate. In this prospective project, I was able to develop a design from scratch, iterate over multiple design reviews with the team, and finally test functionality after parts were fabricated.

Comparison of the "Large Well Plate" to the Industry standard

The "Large Well Plate" that I designed would be able to process the same amount of product of 2 of the industry standard well plate, subsequently cutting the manufacturing time in half. With the possibility of increasing the turnaround of our product so drastically, this project had the potential to make a real impact on the company.

This assembly includes a custom designed aluminum base plate, black abs plastic mid-plate, and polycarbonate lid. OEM O rings, glass frits, and nylon filter meshes are also featured into the design. The assembly itself is held together by metric fasteners which align with tapped holes in the aluminum base plate.

Once assembled, the top layer compresses against an O ring found in the aluminum base cutouts, creating a fluidic seal. My "Raft Filter" Project also listed on this website functioned as a proof of concept for this technology. In addition to allowing for larger batches of product to be processed through this assembly, the LWP (Large Well Plate) also has the robust features of the Raft Filter, allowing for easy removal of filter meshes due to damage or deterioration. After assembly, the polycarbonate lid fits snuggly on top preventing any spillage during shaking.

After the first prototype arrived, small changes were made after testing functionality in the lab. Unfortunately my time at Abcam had come to a close before the second revision could be manufactured. However the performance was still encouraging enough for the team to want to continue to pursue the project.

All in all, this project exposed me to leading a design from the ground floor, and having the foresight to account for dynamic change in a prototype by constraining the design to a top down drawing. Material selection, and force calculations were also necessary in order to achieve optimal compression of the O ring, even in low pressure scenarios. Finally, testing functionality and being able to reflect on what aspects of the design are causing problems was insightful for the use of this technology in the future.
